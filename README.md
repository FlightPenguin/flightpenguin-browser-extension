### Setup

1. Open Chrome browser, paste in this url `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder.
3. Toggle button should be dragged to the right so extension is enabled (blue).
4. Should see extension in toolbar, it will be the letter "h".
5. Click it to see the search form.
6. If you have new updates, click the refresh icon to the left of the blue toggle button, on the extensions page.

### How to Use

1. The search form is mostly populated with default values for ease of testing. You'll need to select providers (Southwest and/or Priceline).
2. Click the "Search" button when ready.
3. Some time will pass...like 5 seconds, then you should be taken to a new tab where flight results will stream in.
4. Click on a row of flight information to select it. Once you make 2 selections, you will be taken to the corresponding provider site.

I'll keep updating this section as I push feature updates.
