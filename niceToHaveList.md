A list of things that didn't make it to the MVP but nice to have.

Search form:

- [ ] Autocomplete on search form and airport code validation

Providers:

- [ ] Begin scraping Skyscanner while its results load to reduce waiting time on search form
- [ ] Make "Back to FlightPenguin" button on provider site more obvious

Results:

- [ ] Plane aircraft type
- [ ] Plane amenities
- [ ] More providers
- [ ] Hiding/showing worse flights
- [ ] Filter
- [ ] Show duration on time bar
- [ ] Highlight airline name with color in time bar
- [ ] Show search progress bar while scraping results
- [ ] Selecting flight takes you to provider confirmation page instead of results
- [ ] Remove "+1" on time since x-axis already gives you day information
- [ ] Mark first result as recommended
- [ ] Easier to read tooltip when hovering over time bars

FlightPenguin.com:

- [ ] Button that links to extension
